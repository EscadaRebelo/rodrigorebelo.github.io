                    <h4>Past, Present & Future</h4>
                    <p>
                        My journey in programming started in college, where I 
                        discovered my passion for coding and problem-solving.
                        Since then, I have been dedicated to improving my skills 
                        and staying up-to-date with the latest web technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the past years i learned to work with several programming languages and many 
                        different software development tools, that gave me the skills required to follow a career in this area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my time in college I had the experience of working with colleagues 
                        in varied projects(including my final graduation project) at the Assisted 
                        Living Computing and Telecommunications Laboratory - ALLab, which gave me the 
                        opportunity of learning a lot about different fields on IT and its research areas. 
                        While working with them, I developed a project called "Monitoring platform and 
                        irrigation control for precision agriculture".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time i developed a stronger taste for Front-End and mobile development, 
                        and so, i decided to further increase my knowledge and capabilities in this topic 
                        by self-teaching and by completing a few online courses in this area. 
                        Since then i've been developing my own Web & mobile apps and working on a 
                        few personal projects that will come out in a foreseeable future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently I'm developing a basketball app for coaches, where they can register
                        players physical data, game statistics, individual and collective practice drills,
                        practice attendance sheet, and a bunch of other features.
                        Players will also have access to the app, to stay in track of their data and to
                        receive updates from the coaching staff. 
                        Ultimately this app has the purpose to facilitate the work of the coaching team 
                        and to motivate athletes by showing them their progression over time.

                    <h3>More about me</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beyond programming, I have many other interests and hobbies. 
                        I have been playing basketball since a young age, and it has become one of my greatest passions. 
                        In addition to playing, I am also a certified basketball referee, 
                        and I enjoy being a part of the game in this capacity as well.
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding or on the basketball court, you can often find me spending quality 
                        time with my friends and family. I believe in the importance of building and maintaining 
                        strong relationships with the people who matter most to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Traveling is another one of my great loves. Exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, 
                        and trying new cuisines bring me immense joy and enrich my life in countless ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In brief, I have many interests, and I love learning about history, music, and science. 
                        I find that these diverse interests help me stay curious, creative, and open-minded in both my 
                        personal and professional life.
                    </p>
        
                    <p class="quote" style="font-size: 0.9rem; opacity: 0.8;">
                        "Dreams without goals are just dreams. And ultimately, they fuel disappointment. 
                        On the road, to achieving your dreams, you must apply discipline but more importantly, 
                        consistency because without commitment you'll never start, but without consistency, you'll never finish." - D.W.
